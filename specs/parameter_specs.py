                'description': 'BOOKING PROCESS\r\n\r\nBookings can be made for any activity featured on our websites by telephone or safely and securely online through our websites.\r\n\r\nAll bookings require a non-refundable deposit at the time of booking to hold the date and time requested. This is stated during the booking process. For some activities we then send you an \'Activation Email\' to make absolutely sure that the booking is correct and that you understand the terms under which you have booked. You must reply to this email for your booking to be placed as requested. Any delay in your reply could result in you losing your preferred date and time, which we cannot be held responsible. When you book online, you provide all the details of the package you require and are requested to acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms and conditions as detailed. Please read the terms of your booking carefully, these are legally binding. When booking online the minimum deposit is taken automatically. If your event is within 31 days or the requested activity carries a full payment on booking requirement (this will be detailed on the website) full payment will be taken on booking\r\n\r\nYour booking prevents others from booking this sporting event on a specific time on a specific date and is therefore subject to a cancellation policy (as detailed in section 8 of these terms and conditions). This is in line with Regulation 6 within the Distance Selling Regulations issued by the Office of Fair Trading. In relation to accommodation or other supplies your booking holds these supplies for you and prevents other prospective customers from booking them and therefore are also subject to the cancellation conditions as described.\r\n\r\nCONFIRMATION\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the required payment, you will receive confirmation of your booking and a receipt for your payment, which will have the address and phone number of the venue and any other relevant information. Please use the postcode provided to generate a map online using Google Maps or use in a SatNav. If you do not receive a full address for the venue on your receipt it is your responsibility to contact us immediately and request these details. If you fail to do this and cannot find the venue you accept full responsibility. We can be contacted by email during a normal working week on: admin@activityhq.com, and by phone seven days a week. Please view our booking office hours. Please have full details of your booked event to hand.\r\n\r\nFor most activities (see below for exceptions), the full balance becomes payable no less than 31 days prior to the date of your event. If an online booking is placed within 31 days of the requested booking date full payment is taken automatically if we can place your requested package or the most suitable package for your group size, type and age, within a two hour period either way of the time you have specified. If it is not possible for you to take part in the activity other than the exact time you have specified online, you must state this in the notes section otherwise we will place your activity as outlined above.\r\n\r\nIf you have paid your deposit by card, your balance payment will automatically be taken from the same card unless you advise us otherwise no later than 31 days prior to your event date. If you wish to pay the balance by any other means we must receive this payment no less than 31 days prior to the date of your event having notified us of this change in payment method in writing to accounts@activityhq.com. No reminders are issued. Your booking will be automatically cancelled and you will lose your deposit if your balance payment is not received on or before this deadline. This also applies to all declined card transactions.\r\n\r\nPAINTBALL\r\n\r\nTo book paintball we require the basic game fee paid on booking. This is the Pay as You Play package amount and this pays for your game fee and all your equipment, but not paintballs. Upgrading to package or buying paintballs and other sundries can be done when booking or at a later date, however all outstanding balances for packages must be received no later than 4 working days prior to the game date, and other discounted paintball packages no later than 2 working days prior to event date.\r\n\r\nZORBING, RALLY DRIVING /HIGH PERFORMANCE CARS\r\n\r\nIn the case of a booking for sphering (zorbing), rally driving or any event that includes driving any type of high performance car, full payment is required on booking and no refunds are given. In the case of high performance cars, you may re-schedule your date, subject to availability, up to 21 days prior to the event. The admin fee to do this is GBP 30 a booking.\r\n\r\nCANCELLATION CHARGES\r\n\r\nOnce we have taken your deposit and your booking is confirmed with the activity provider your right to cancel without penalty ends: The terms of cancellation are as follows:\r\n\r\nOnce a deposit is taken and your booking is confirmed with the activity provider: Loss of deposit\r\n\r\n31 days or more prior to the event: Full refund of monies paid less deposit.\r\n\r\n31 days or less prior to the event: No refund.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a booking for sphering (zorbing) or high performance car package full payment is made on booking and there are no refunds available.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a paintball booking the full game fee (Pay as You Play) is payable on booking and no refunds are available. However, any portion of a package, over and above a basic game fee, is refundable as are additional paintballs providing the cancellation is received before 31 days prior to the game date.\r\n\r\nOur accepted date of cancellation for any booking is the date that your written cancellation is acknowledged in writing by us. If you have not received an acknowledgment in writing, we have not received your cancellation and your booking remains in place. We can be contacted at the address at the foot of these terms and conditions or by email: admin@activityhq.com\r\n\r\nIf catering or any other supply is included in the package, this may also be subject to cancellation charges.\r\n\r\nThe 31day rule includes weekends and bank holidays.\r\n\r\nAny reduction in numbers must also be confirmed in writing and acknowledged in writing by us to be considered valid.\r\n\r\nAny changes in participant numbers are subject to the same cancellation charges as stated above.\r\n\r\nVerbal changes and cancellations are not accepted in any circumstances.\r\n\r\nBAD WEATHER / OTHER UNAVOIDABLE CIRCUMSTANCES\r\n\r\nIf an activity provider cancels due to bad weather or any other unavoidable circumstances, your booking will be rescheduled to a mutually convenient date for you and the activity provider. You can chose a date up to three months after the original booked date. This is arranged between the activity provider and you. We will not get involved. If a cancellation is due to a venue closing or becoming unsuitably qualified to remain on our network, we will offer you at a similar venue nearby. Bookings at all-weather venues will not be eligible for a refund if the activity provider is prepared to run the session. A customer decision not to take part in these circumstances will result in it being deemed that they have cancelled their booking and such action will be treated as a normal cancellation and charges as stated will apply.\r\n\r\nGROUP BOOKINGS\r\n\r\nDiscounted bookings for large groups are priced on the number of participants. A large group is classed at 20 participants and over. Should you reduce your group size at any time prior to the event the booking will be re-priced accordingly and further charges may apply. If the reduction causes your group size to fall below the minimum requirement, the price for the minimum group will still be charged regardless of attendees. In addition to the re-pricing, cancellation charges, as outlined above, apply to each person that is cancelled in a group booking. Please note that an existing booking that does not qualify for a discount at the time of booking cannot acquire a discounted status by the addition of extra participants at a later date. A booked "team" classified event can add further teams to their booking if there is availability but cannot increase their existing team sizes at a later date. If a reduction in a group size results in the activity provider canceling your event you will still be subject to the cancellation charges as detailed in these terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nARRIVING LATE\r\n\r\nAll the activity providers on our network require participants to be ready to take part in the activity 15 to 30 minutes prior to a designated "start-time" to enable a full safety briefing to take place. The time you receive on your confirmation is your "start time" with a recommendation to arrive at the venue 30 minutes prior (some activity providers require you to be there even earlier, so please check this on your confirmation). Please ensure that you follow the guidelines of arrival times. All activity providers will do their best to accommodate late arrivals but this cannot be guaranteed, especially during busy periods. It is unlikely that customers will be allowed to participate if they have missed the pre-session safety briefing. Some activity providers will make an exception to this and provide individual safety briefings, but this in entirely at the individual activity provider\'s discretion and cannot be guaranteed. No participant may take part in any activity without first attending a safety briefing as designated by the individual activity provider. The booking will normally be treated as a cancellation in the event of late arrival with the loss of all monies and the activity provider will turn you away, particularly if they have a busy schedule to meet. This is their right to do so. Your acceptance of this proviso forms part of any booking. Please take arrival times seriously allowing for any possible delays on route to the venue.\r\n\r\nEXCLUSION FROM VENUE\r\n\r\nThe activity provider has the right, at all times, to refuse participants access to the booked activity at any stage of the booking and remove them from their venue if in their opinion the participants are under the permitted age; are the incorrect height or weight; are unfit to take part in the activity because of physical or mental impairment; be under the influence of alcohol or drugs; have arrived too late to take part in the pre-activity briefing; consider them to be a danger to themselves, other participants or members of staff ; or are displaying aggressive and abusive behaviour (verbal or physical). If any of these occurrences apply, the booking will have been deemed to have been cancelled and cancellation charges will apply. There are no exceptions.\r\n\r\nShould any participant damage the property of the activity provider of verbally or physically injure a member of the staff or other participants, they will be dealt with by the venue management accordingly and may face prosecution by the activity provider. We will not become involved in such matters other than to supply the activity provider and authorities with contact details of the offending party / parties. Any communications relating to such matters should be conducted between the activity provider, the offending party / parties and the authorities.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL SAFETY / HEALTH REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nWhilst all the activities featured on our websites are as safe as they can be given their inherent physical dangers, it MUST be understood that all safety instructions, directions, warnings and all other instructions must be followed at all times during your time at the venue. You must satisfy yourself before taking part that you and the members of your group have listened and understood all safety instructions and are wearing any safety equipment or clothing properly. If in any doubt you must seek further guidance and help from the activity provider immediately. You are advised not to attempt to go beyond your capabilities or engage in risky or daring behaviour. All physical activities by definition involve an element of risk so it is a given that you undertake the activity with the full understanding of this and accept responsibility for your own safety and the risks involved in taking part together with that of any minors for whom you have responsibility. In the case of more than one person taking part under one booking it is a given that the person booking the group with us has relayed the details of the activities to the group and that the individuals in the group have acknowledged the possible risks involved and that they have agreed to take part on this basis. You are advised to ensure that your personal insurance cover is up to date and that you are covered for taking part in such activities for your particular circumstances and health. Before taking part in any of our featured activities you must be physically and mentally fit and be capable of taking instructions. You will be asked to sign a disclaimer before taking part in many activities to say you are mentally and medically fit and well. If you are in any doubt you must check with your GP prior to making any booking. If you refuse to sign a disclaimer you will not be able to take part and such an action will be treated as a cancellation. When taking part in any car driving experiences you may also be required to pay a \'damage protection\' insurance of up to GBP 30 on the day to cover accidental damage by you or any one of your group. Failure to pay this damage protection leaves you liable to pay up to GBP 2,900 for any damage you or your group cause.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY DESCRIPTIONS / RESTRICTIONS\r\n\r\nAll the activities featured on our websites are described in as much detail as possible and are correct at the time each booking is made. All prices are per person unless specifically stated otherwise in your activation email. All timings for activities are the total time for the sessions and not an indication of a per person allocation. From time to time activities do change both in price, type and duration. When we receive notification of any changes from any activity providers on our network we amend our websites accordingly as soon as possible. These changes can be made for various reasons including but not limited to health and safety considerations, loss of a facility or changes to the product range of the activity provider. As a Booking Agency we have no control over such changes. Only if these changes make a significant difference to the product that will be delivered will you be informed. If the change involves a different format of the same activity then we do not consider this to be significant. If a change to an activity is made on the date of delivery and you are not happy with the change you must take this up with the activity provider. Our Booking Advisors will make every effort to provide additional information and clarification about any of our featured activities, however customers are deemed to have thoroughly familiarised themselves with the activity description, all restrictions, including height, weight and age restriction as detailed on our websites before booking the activity. No responsibility can be accepted by us for an inappropriate booking if you do not familiarise yourself with all aspects of the activity in question at the venue chosen either on our website or through your own enquiries before placing a booking. This is your responsibility.\r\n\r\nAGE RESTRICTIONS\r\n\r\nAge restrictions are clearly stated on our websites. In the case of paintball this is generally 12 years old; however some providers require a higher minimum age. Please ensure that you comply with the minimum age restriction as participants who do not meet the minimum requirement will be turned away from the site.\r\n\r\nPaintball: - UKPSF guidelines state:\r\n\r\nPlayers aged 12 or 13 years must have a responsible adult playing with them throughout the session. Players between the ages of 14 and 16years must have a responsible adult on the paintball site at all times. In addition the site must be in possession of a signed parental consent form before these age groups can take part. These forms are available to every participant during the booking process.\r\n\r\nVENUE CHANGE\r\n\r\nIf for any reason an activity provider cannot take your booking after it has been booked, we will offer you the same or a similar package at the nearest venue. You will be notified of any such change as soon as we are made aware that the activity provider, with whom you are booked, cannot fulfil the booking. Should you decide to cancel your booking in this particular instance, a full refund will be given. However, if the activity provider can fulfil the booking and you decided to change the venue for your activity for your own reasons this will be treated like a new booking as we will have to cancel the activity provider holding your original booking, which may incur cancellation charges as outlined above.\r\nDRIVING LICENCE\r\n\r\nFor karting and quad biking no driving licence is required, however, when taking parting in off-roading or a car driving experience, you must have held a full UK licence for at least one year (F1 driving experience 3 years). You must also take your licence for inspection on the day. Failure to produce a licence for this type of activity will result in you not taking part in the activity and this will be deemed as a cancellation.\r\n\r\nLATE START\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of our featured activities, unforeseen circumstances can delay the start of an event. In all cases the activity provider will endeavour to minimise your inconvenience and will offer you a later start time, other \'fill-in\' activities or, in some cases, an alternative date. The action taken will be dependant on the circumstances surrounding the situation. As such incidences cannot be predicted your understanding is appreciated. Should you choose not to accept the alternatives offered to you and do not take part in the activity either on the same date at the time offered or the alternative date, no recompense is offered by us as the Booking agency. However, it is the activity provider\'s ultimate decision and all communications as a result of such circumstances should be with the activity provider directly as it will be deemed that we have fulfilled the duties of a Booking Agent with you.\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\nIf you are dissatisfied with your booked activity in any respect, or you have any other complaint about the activity provider, the activity or any other matter in relation to the venue or it\'s performance, then you must speak to the activity provider on the day and come to an agreement about how you can resolve the situation. It will not be considered reasonable if you have not brought your dissatisfaction to the attention of the activity provider at the time and then complain later. If you take part in an activity, either the booked activity or a replacement offered by the activity provider on the day, it is likely to be deemed by the activity provider that you consider that the activity of which you took part is entirely acceptable to you and that a complaint at a later date is unlikely to be considered by the activity provider. We represent a network of activity providers as a booking agent only and therefore do not deliver the activities personally, so please deal with the activity provider directly in any circumstances that do not relate to the actual booking process. However, should you have a complaint about the way in which we handled your booking, please email: customer.services@activityhq.com. All communications with Customer Services must be made in writing, as this ensures that all aspects of the communication between us are clear and unambiguous. Once we receive your complaint we will investigate your claim and discuss the matter with the relevant parties. When we have gathered all the necessary information, we will get back to you.\r\n\r\nREFUNDS\r\n\r\nShould you be deemed eligible for a refund then this will be for the agreed amount with the absolute maximum amount being the monies you have paid to us and will not extend to consequential loss or claimed inconvenience or stress howsoever caused. No exceptions are made in this regard. If you have taken part in any activity during the booked event in question, regardless of the circumstances or conditions under which you took part, then this will negate any applicable refund.\r\n\r\nVOUCHERS\r\n\r\nActivity vouchers can be purchased from our websites or by phone. You can choose the type of delivery, by post or email, as you book online or over the phone. If you do not receive your voucher you must contact us immediately. If you do not contact us within 10 days of the purchase date in this regard, it will be deemed that you are in possession of your voucher and any subsequent requests for a duplicate will incur an admin fee. Should a duplicate be issued, the original voucher automatically becomes void.\r\n\r\nREDEMPTION\r\n\r\nYou must redeem your voucher prior to the expiry date specified on your voucher or your voucher will be automatically logged as expired and no redemption will be possible. In order to redeem a voucher you will require the Unique ID &amp;amp; Expiry Date printed on the front of the voucher this is your redemption validation information. Using this information vouchers should be redeemed on our online redemption system only. Visit http://www.theactivitypeople.co.uk/gift-vouchers/ to redeem online. It is the bearer\'s responsibility to keep this information safe as, once redemption has been processed using the redemption validation information further attempts at redemption using the same information cannot and will not be authorised.\r\n\r\nVoucher redemption against a particular activity on a particular date is strictly subject to availability at the time of booking and cannot be guaranteed. Please book early to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\nAny number of fully priced vouchers can be used against any one booking, however ONLY ONE discounted or free voucher can be used against any one booking. e.g. 3 x full priced vouchers together with 1 x free or discounted voucher can be used against one booking\r\n\r\nRedeemed Vouchers\r\n\r\nOnce a voucher has been used to make an activity booking voucher terms and conditions no longer apply, as booking terms and conditions are then applicable. These are detailed in the terms and conditions printed here.\r\n\r\nExpired Vouchers\r\n\r\nEach voucher has an expiry date printed clearly on the voucher. Unless you have extended your voucher as below, once you reach your expiry date the voucher becomes invalid. No exceptions can be made.\r\n\r\nExtension of Validity\r\n\r\nYou may extend your vouchers validity online at this address: http://www.activitybooker.co.uk/extension.php. There is a fee of GBP 5.99 per voucher and only un-expired vouchers that have a minimum of one week\'s validity remaining may be extended. The extension is for a further 1 month. All vouchers conditions apply to extended vouchers. A voucher can be extended 3 times only. Paying for an extension on a voucher gives the holder an extended period of validity; it does not increase the value of the voucher.\r\n\r\nLost Vouchers\r\n\r\nWe do not accept responsibility for lost vouchers or for any other person gaining access to voucher information and redeeming it in your place. The possession of any valid voucher details by any person gives them the right to redeem that voucher. There are no exceptions.\r\n\r\nVenue / Activity Specific Vouchers\r\n\r\nIf your voucher is for a specific activity or venue and we cannot accommodate you at that particular venue or for that particular activity for whatever reason we will offer you an alternative at the nearest venue. The alternate will be the nearest match to the specified activity. If you decide not to take advantage of the alternative we will refund monies paid. Any refund will be paid back onto the original card used to purchase the voucher. Please note that if you have accepted the alternative offered and a booking is in place voucher terms and conditions no longer apply. You then have a booking and Booking terms and conditions apply as detailed here.\r\n\r\nCash / Credit Value\r\n\r\nOur vouchers do not have any cash or credit value other than as payment or part-payment towards an activity as detailed on our websites. Should the value of the voucher exceed that of the activity chosen, no cash refund or credit is given against the balance. Should the voucher value not be sufficient to cover an activity because of a price increase, the bearer will be expected to pay any outstanding balance before the booking can be made.\r\n\r\nVoucher Delivered With Balloons &amp;amp; Other Products\r\n\r\nWe offer to supply helium filled balloon/s with a voucher as selected by the customer. Each balloon will be secured by a ribbon and a weight and sent in boxes that are deemed suitable for this type of product by Royal Mail.

Where there is sufficient time before dispatch, our supplier will contact the customer and an alternative offered. Helium foil 18" balloons normally float for at least a week and usually two to three weeks. However in cold temperatures the helium may cause the balloon to appear deflated. Put in a warmer environment and the helium expands inflating the balloon. Once a delivery has been signed for at the address specified on the original order, our supplier will no longer be responsible and refunds will not be given if the balloon does not pass onto the named recipient.

No refunds will be given for late deliveries or goods damaged by recipients. Our supplier will make the decision about the cause of damage and state that once this decision is made, no further correspondence will be entered into in this regard. Any dates quoted for delivery of orders are approximate and our supplier states that they shall not be liable for any delay in delivery howsoever caused. In the event of a claim, settlement will be limited to the value of the goods, if defective or damaged in transit, our supplier will not extend payment for consequential loss or claimed inconvenience or stress howsoever caused.\r\n\r\nFree Gifts\r\n\r\nWhen we choose to provide a customer with a free gift, no recompense and / or replacement are offered in any circumstances in response to a complaint.\r\n\r\nFREE VOUCHERS, DISCOUNT VOUCHERS &amp;amp; FOC PROMOTIONS\r\n\r\nFree OR Discounted Vouchers are classed as \'open so you can use them as part-payment for any activity published on our websites\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE\r\n\r\nOnly one free or discounted voucher can be used against any one booking when you redeem your vouchers.\r\n\r\nFree &amp;amp; Discounted vouchers are valid only when used against fully published price\r\n\r\nFree and discounted vouchers can be used with vouchers that have been purchased at full price as part payment for one booking but ONLY ONE discounted or free voucher can be used against the \'same booking\'**\r\n\r\n**Same booking is identified as the same activity package on the same date and time at the same venue.\r\n\r\nPOSTAGE CHARGED FOR DELIVERY OF VOUCHERS\r\n\r\nPostage charged is for up to 4 vouchers per envelope posted to the same address. Each address is treated as a separate delivery and will incur a separate postage charge.

            'terms/terms': 'BOOKING PROCESS\r\n\r\nBookings can be made for any activity featured on our websites by telephone or safely and securely online through our websites.\r\n\r\nAll bookings require a non-refundable deposit at the time of booking to hold the date and time requested. This is stated during the booking process. For some activities we then send you an \'Activation Email\' to make absolutely sure that the booking is correct and that you understand the terms under which you have booked. You must reply to this email for your booking to be placed as requested. Any delay in your reply could result in you losing your preferred date and time, which we cannot be held responsible. When you book online, you provide all the details of the package you require and are requested to acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms and conditions as detailed. Please read the terms of your booking carefully, these are legally binding. When booking online the minimum deposit is taken automatically. If your event is within 31 days or the requested activity carries a full payment on booking requirement (this will be detailed on the website) full payment will be taken on booking\r\n\r\nYour booking prevents others from booking this sporting event on a specific time on a specific date and is therefore subject to a cancellation policy (as detailed in section 8 of these terms and conditions). This is in line with Regulation 6 within the Distance Selling Regulations issued by the Office of Fair Trading. In relation to accommodation or other supplies your booking holds these supplies for you and prevents other prospective customers from booking them and therefore are also subject to the cancellation conditions as described.\r\n\r\nCONFIRMATION\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the required payment, you will receive confirmation of your booking and a receipt for your payment, which will have the address and phone number of the venue and any other relevant information. Please use the postcode provided to generate a map online using Google Maps or use in a SatNav. If you do not receive a full address for the venue on your receipt it is your responsibility to contact us immediately and request these details. If you fail to do this and cannot find the venue you accept full responsibility. We can be contacted by email during a normal working week on: admin@activityhq.com, and by phone seven days a week. Please view our booking office hours. Please have full details of your booked event to hand.\r\n\r\nFor most activities (see below for exceptions), the full balance becomes payable no less than 31 days prior to the date of your event. If an online booking is placed within 31 days of the requested booking date full payment is taken automatically if we can place your requested package or the most suitable package for your group size, type and age, within a two hour period either way of the time you have specified. If it is not possible for you to take part in the activity other than the exact time you have specified online, you must state this in the notes section otherwise we will place your activity as outlined above.\r\n\r\nIf you have paid your deposit by card, your balance payment will automatically be taken from the same card unless you advise us otherwise no later than 31 days prior to your event date. If you wish to pay the balance by any other means we must receive this payment no less than 31 days prior to the date of your event having notified us of this change in payment method in writing to accounts@activityhq.com. No reminders are issued. Your booking will be automatically cancelled and you will lose your deposit if your balance payment is not received on or before this deadline. This also applies to all declined card transactions.\r\n\r\nPAINTBALL\r\n\r\nTo book paintball we require the basic game fee paid on booking. This is the Pay as You Play package amount and this pays for your game fee and all your equipment, but not paintballs. Upgrading to package or buying paintballs and other sundries can be done when booking or at a later date, however all outstanding balances for packages must be received no later than 4 working days prior to the game date, and other discounted paintball packages no later than 2 working days prior to event date.\r\n\r\nZORBING, RALLY DRIVING /HIGH PERFORMANCE CARS\r\n\r\nIn the case of a booking for sphering (zorbing), rally driving or any event that includes driving any type of high performance car, full payment is required on booking and no refunds are given. In the case of high performance cars, you may re-schedule your date, subject to availability, up to 21 days prior to the event. The admin fee to do this is GBP 30 a booking.\r\n\r\nCANCELLATION CHARGES\r\n\r\nOnce we have taken your deposit and your booking is confirmed with the activity provider your right to cancel without penalty ends: The terms of cancellation are as follows:\r\n\r\nOnce a deposit is taken and your booking is confirmed with the activity provider: Loss of deposit\r\n\r\n31 days or more prior to the event: Full refund of monies paid less deposit.\r\n\r\n31 days or less prior to the event: No refund.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a booking for sphering (zorbing) or high performance car package full payment is made on booking and there are no refunds available.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a paintball booking the full game fee (Pay as You Play) is payable on booking and no refunds are available. However, any portion of a package, over and above a basic game fee, is refundable as are additional paintballs providing the cancellation is received before 31 days prior to the game date.\r\n\r\nOur accepted date of cancellation for any booking is the date that your written cancellation is acknowledged in writing by us. If you have not received an acknowledgment in writing, we have not received your cancellation and your booking remains in place. We can be contacted at the address at the foot of these terms and conditions or by email: admin@activityhq.com\r\n\r\nIf catering or any other supply is included in the package, this may also be subject to cancellation charges.\r\n\r\nThe 31day rule includes weekends and bank holidays.\r\n\r\nAny reduction in numbers must also be confirmed in writing and acknowledged in writing by us to be considered valid.\r\n\r\nAny changes in participant numbers are subject to the same cancellation charges as stated above.\r\n\r\nVerbal changes and cancellations are not accepted in any circumstances.\r\n\r\nBAD WEATHER / OTHER UNAVOIDABLE CIRCUMSTANCES\r\n\r\nIf an activity provider cancels due to bad weather or any other unavoidable circumstances, your booking will be rescheduled to a mutually convenient date for you and the activity provider. You can chose a date up to three months after the original booked date. This is arranged between the activity provider and you. We will not get involved. If a cancellation is due to a venue closing or becoming unsuitably qualified to remain on our network, we will offer you at a similar venue nearby. Bookings at all-weather venues will not be eligible for a refund if the activity provider is prepared to run the session. A customer decision not to take part in these circumstances will result in it being deemed that they have cancelled their booking and such action will be treated as a normal cancellation and charges as stated will apply.\r\n\r\nGROUP BOOKINGS\r\n\r\nDiscounted bookings for large groups are priced on the number of participants. A large group is classed at 20 participants and over. Should you reduce your group size at any time prior to the event the booking will be re-priced accordingly and further charges may apply. If the reduction causes your group size to fall below the minimum requirement, the price for the minimum group will still be charged regardless of attendees. In addition to the re-pricing, cancellation charges, as outlined above, apply to each person that is cancelled in a group booking. Please note that an existing booking that does not qualify for a discount at the time of booking cannot acquire a discounted status by the addition of extra participants at a later date. A booked "team" classified event can add further teams to their booking if there is availability but cannot increase their existing team sizes at a later date. If a reduction in a group size results in the activity provider canceling your event you will still be subject to the cancellation charges as detailed in these terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nARRIVING LATE\r\n\r\nAll the activity providers on our network require participants to be ready to take part in the activity 15 to 30 minutes prior to a designated "start-time" to enable a full safety briefing to take place. The time you receive on your confirmation is your "start time" with a recommendation to arrive at the venue 30 minutes prior (some activity providers require you to be there even earlier, so please check this on your confirmation). Please ensure that you follow the guidelines of arrival times. All activity providers will do their best to accommodate late arrivals but this cannot be guaranteed, especially during busy periods. It is unlikely that customers will be allowed to participate if they have missed the pre-session safety briefing. Some activity providers will make an exception to this and provide individual safety briefings, but this in entirely at the individual activity provider\'s discretion and cannot be guaranteed. No participant may take part in any activity without first attending a safety briefing as designated by the individual activity provider. The booking will normally be treated as a cancellation in the event of late arrival with the loss of all monies and the activity provider will turn you away, particularly if they have a busy schedule to meet. This is their right to do so. Your acceptance of this proviso forms part of any booking. Please take arrival times seriously allowing for any possible delays on route to the venue.\r\n\r\nEXCLUSION FROM VENUE\r\n\r\nThe activity provider has the right, at all times, to refuse participants access to the booked activity at any stage of the booking and remove them from their venue if in their opinion the participants are under the permitted age; are the incorrect height or weight; are unfit to take part in the activity because of physical or mental impairment; be under the influence of alcohol or drugs; have arrived too late to take part in the pre-activity briefing; consider them to be a danger to themselves, other participants or members of staff ; or are displaying aggressive and abusive behaviour (verbal or physical). If any of these occurrences apply, the booking will have been deemed to have been cancelled and cancellation charges will apply. There are no exceptions.\r\n\r\nShould any participant damage the property of the activity provider of verbally or physically injure a member of the staff or other participants, they will be dealt with by the venue management accordingly and may face prosecution by the activity provider. We will not become involved in such matters other than to supply the activity provider and authorities with contact details of the offending party / parties. Any communications relating to such matters should be conducted between the activity provider, the offending party / parties and the authorities.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL SAFETY / HEALTH REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nWhilst all the activities featured on our websites are as safe as they can be given their inherent physical dangers, it MUST be understood that all safety instructions, directions, warnings and all other instructions must be followed at all times during your time at the venue. You must satisfy yourself before taking part that you and the members of your group have listened and understood all safety instructions and are wearing any safety equipment or clothing properly. If in any doubt you must seek further guidance and help from the activity provider immediately. You are advised not to attempt to go beyond your capabilities or engage in risky or daring behaviour. All physical activities by definition involve an element of risk so it is a given that you undertake the activity with the full understanding of this and accept responsibility for your own safety and the risks involved in taking part together with that of any minors for whom you have responsibility. In the case of more than one person taking part under one booking it is a given that the person booking the group with us has relayed the details of the activities to the group and that the individuals in the group have acknowledged the possible risks involved and that they have agreed to take part on this basis. You are advised to ensure that your personal insurance cover is up to date and that you are covered for taking part in such activities for your particular circumstances and health. Before taking part in any of our featured activities you must be physically and mentally fit and be capable of taking instructions. You will be asked to sign a disclaimer before taking part in many activities to say you are mentally and medically fit and well. If you are in any doubt you must check with your GP prior to making any booking. If you refuse to sign a disclaimer you will not be able to take part and such an action will be treated as a cancellation. When taking part in any car driving experiences you may also be required to pay a \'damage protection\' insurance of up to GBP 30 on the day to cover accidental damage by you or any one of your group. Failure to pay this damage protection leaves you liable to pay up to GBP 2,900 for any damage you or your group cause.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY DESCRIPTIONS / RESTRICTIONS\r\n\r\nAll the activities featured on our websites are described in as much detail as possible and are correct at the time each booking is made. All prices are per person unless specifically stated otherwise in your activation email. All timings for activities are the total time for the sessions and not an indication of a per person allocation. From time to time activities do change both in price, type and duration. When we receive notification of any changes from any activity providers on our network we amend our websites accordingly as soon as possible. These changes can be made for various reasons including but not limited to health and safety considerations, loss of a facility or changes to the product range of the activity provider. As a Booking Agency we have no control over such changes. Only if these changes make a significant difference to the product that will be delivered will you be informed. If the change involves a different format of the same activity then we do not consider this to be significant. If a change to an activity is made on the date of delivery and you are not happy with the change you must take this up with the activity provider. Our Booking Advisors will make every effort to provide additional information and clarification about any of our featured activities, however customers are deemed to have thoroughly familiarised themselves with the activity description, all restrictions, including height, weight and age restriction as detailed on our websites before booking the activity. No responsibility can be accepted by us for an inappropriate booking if you do not familiarise yourself with all aspects of the activity in question at the venue chosen either on our website or through your own enquiries before placing a booking. This is your responsibility.\r\n\r\nAGE RESTRICTIONS\r\n\r\nAge restrictions are clearly stated on our websites. In the case of paintball this is generally 12 years old; however some providers require a higher minimum age. Please ensure that you comply with the minimum age restriction as participants who do not meet the minimum requirement will be turned away from the site.\r\n\r\nPaintball: - UKPSF guidelines state:\r\n\r\nPlayers aged 12 or 13 years must have a responsible adult playing with them throughout the session. Players between the ages of 14 and 16years must have a responsible adult on the paintball site at all times. In addition the site must be in possession of a signed parental consent form before these age groups can take part. These forms are available to every participant during the booking process.\r\n\r\nVENUE CHANGE\r\n\r\nIf for any reason an activity provider cannot take your booking after it has been booked, we will offer you the same or a similar package at the nearest venue. You will be notified of any such change as soon as we are made aware that the activity provider, with whom you are booked, cannot fulfil the booking. Should you decide to cancel your booking in this particular instance, a full refund will be given. However, if the activity provider can fulfil the booking and you decided to change the venue for your activity for your own reasons this will be treated like a new booking as we will have to cancel the activity provider holding your original booking, which may incur cancellation charges as outlined above.\r\nDRIVING LICENCE\r\n\r\nFor karting and quad biking no driving licence is required, however, when taking parting in off-roading or a car driving experience, you must have held a full UK licence for at least one year (F1 driving experience 3 years). You must also take your licence for inspection on the day. Failure to produce a licence for this type of activity will result in you not taking part in the activity and this will be deemed as a cancellation.\r\n\r\nLATE START\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of our featured activities, unforeseen circumstances can delay the start of an event. In all cases the activity provider will endeavour to minimise your inconvenience and will offer you a later start time, other \'fill-in\' activities or, in some cases, an alternative date. The action taken will be dependant on the circumstances surrounding the situation. As such incidences cannot be predicted your understanding is appreciated. Should you choose not to accept the alternatives offered to you and do not take part in the activity either on the same date at the time offered or the alternative date, no recompense is offered by us as the Booking agency. However, it is the activity provider\'s ultimate decision and all communications as a result of such circumstances should be with the activity provider directly as it will be deemed that we have fulfilled the duties of a Booking Agent with you.\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\nIf you are dissatisfied with your booked activity in any respect, or you have any other complaint about the activity provider, the activity or any other matter in relation to the venue or it\'s performance, then you must speak to the activity provider on the day and come to an agreement about how you can resolve the situation. It will not be considered reasonable if you have not brought your dissatisfaction to the attention of the activity provider at the time and then complain later. If you take part in an activity, either the booked activity or a replacement offered by the activity provider on the day, it is likely to be deemed by the activity provider that you consider that the activity of which you took part is entirely acceptable to you and that a complaint at a later date is unlikely to be considered by the activity provider. We represent a network of activity providers as a booking agent only and therefore do not deliver the activities personally, so please deal with the activity provider directly in any circumstances that do not relate to the actual booking process. However, should you have a complaint about the way in which we handled your booking, please email: customer.services@activityhq.com. All communications with Customer Services must be made in writing, as this ensures that all aspects of the communication between us are clear and unambiguous. Once we receive your complaint we will investigate your claim and discuss the matter with the relevant parties. When we have gathered all the necessary information, we will get back to you.\r\n\r\nREFUNDS\r\n\r\nShould you be deemed eligible for a refund then this will be for the agreed amount with the absolute maximum amount being the monies you have paid to us and will not extend to consequential loss or claimed inconvenience or stress howsoever caused. No exceptions are made in this regard. If you have taken part in any activity during the booked event in question, regardless of the circumstances or conditions under which you took part, then this will negate any applicable refund.\r\n\r\nVOUCHERS\r\n\r\nActivity vouchers can be purchased from our websites or by phone. You can choose the type of delivery, by post or email, as you book online or over the phone. If you do not receive your voucher you must contact us immediately. If you do not contact us within 10 days of the purchase date in this regard, it will be deemed that you are in possession of your voucher and any subsequent requests for a duplicate will incur an admin fee. Should a duplicate be issued, the original voucher automatically becomes void.\r\n\r\nREDEMPTION\r\n\r\nYou must redeem your voucher prior to the expiry date specified on your voucher or your voucher will be automatically logged as expired and no redemption will be possible. In order to redeem a voucher you will require the Unique ID &amp;amp; Expiry Date printed on the front of the voucher this is your redemption validation information. Using this information vouchers should be redeemed on our online redemption system only. Visit http://www.theactivitypeople.co.uk/gift-vouchers/ to redeem online. It is the bearer\'s responsibility to keep this information safe as, once redemption has been processed using the redemption validation information further attempts at redemption using the same information cannot and will not be authorised.\r\n\r\nVoucher redemption against a particular activity on a particular date is strictly subject to availability at the time of booking and cannot be guaranteed. Please book early to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\nAny number of fully priced vouchers can be used against any one booking, however ONLY ONE discounted or free voucher can be used against any one booking. e.g. 3 x full priced vouchers together with 1 x free or discounted voucher can be used against one booking\r\n\r\nRedeemed Vouchers\r\n\r\nOnce a voucher has been used to make an activity booking voucher terms and conditions no longer apply, as booking terms and conditions are then applicable. These are detailed in the terms and conditions printed here.\r\n\r\nExpired Vouchers\r\n\r\nEach voucher has an expiry date printed clearly on the voucher. Unless you have extended your voucher as below, once you reach your expiry date the voucher becomes invalid. No exceptions can be made.\r\n\r\nExtension of Validity\r\n\r\nYou may extend your vouchers validity online at this address: http://www.activitybooker.co.uk/extension.php. There is a fee of GBP 5.99 per voucher and only un-expired vouchers that have a minimum of one week\'s validity remaining may be extended. The extension is for a further 1 month. All vouchers conditions apply to extended vouchers. A voucher can be extended 3 times only. Paying for an extension on a voucher gives the holder an extended period of validity; it does not increase the value of the voucher.\r\n\r\nLost Vouchers\r\n\r\nWe do not accept responsibility for lost vouchers or for any other person gaining access to voucher information and redeeming it in your place. The possession of any valid voucher details by any person gives them the right to redeem that voucher. There are no exceptions.\r\n\r\nVenue / Activity Specific Vouchers\r\n\r\nIf your voucher is for a specific activity or venue and we cannot accommodate you at that particular venue or for that particular activity for whatever reason we will offer you an alternative at the nearest venue. The alternate will be the nearest match to the specified activity. If you decide not to take advantage of the alternative we will refund monies paid. Any refund will be paid back onto the original card used to purchase the voucher. Please note that if you have accepted the alternative offered and a booking is in place voucher terms and conditions no longer apply. You then have a booking and Booking terms and conditions apply as detailed here.\r\n\r\nCash / Credit Value\r\n\r\nOur vouchers do not have any cash or credit value other than as payment or part-payment towards an activity as detailed on our websites. Should the value of the voucher exceed that of the activity chosen, no cash refund or credit is given against the balance. Should the voucher value not be sufficient to cover an activity because of a price increase, the bearer will be expected to pay any outstanding balance before the booking can be made.\r\n\r\nVoucher Delivered With Balloons &amp;amp; Other Products\r\n\r\nWe offer to supply helium filled balloon/s with a voucher as selected by the customer.
